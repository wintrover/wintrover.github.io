  Results-oriented aspiring AI Developer with a strong interest in LLM and NLP fields.<br />
  After graduating with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, I have gained effective communication skills and business acumen through diverse experiences not only in technical fields such as technical support and front-end development, but also in sales and business strategy.<br />
  Furthermore, through projects in the Intel Developer Program, I have built various deep learning models across both LLM and computer vision fields, gaining extensive experience up to actual service deployment.<br />
  With my technical skills from Python and related AI/ML framework experience, and a solid customer-centric mindset, I have the ambition to innovate UX and build impactful AI solutions.<br />
